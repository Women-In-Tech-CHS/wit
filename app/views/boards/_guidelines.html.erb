      <h3>Keep It Civil</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Debate and disagreements on points of substance are okay, but personal attacks, hate speech, petty bickering, trolling, and thread hijacking are not tolerated. By choosing to be civil, you make the discussion better for everyone involved.</li>
        <li>Act in a give and take manner; help others as often as or more than you ask for help.</li>
        <li>Be helpful and supportive. We’re all members of the same community, so please be constructive when providing feedback.</li>
        <li>Watch your sense of humor, posts may be read by people from a variety of backgrounds and ages.</li>

      <h3>Posting In The Forum</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Beafore posting a new topic, search the other posts to see if your topic is already covered.</li>
        <li>Use a meaningful title for your thread. Do not use words like ”urgent” or ”important” in your subject line, be patient.</li>
        <li>Stick to the topic. Please stay on the thread’s topic when replying to an existing thread. If you don’t see an open thread about something you’d like to discuss, please create a new topic.</li>
        <li>Do not use a thread for a private conversations.</li>
        <li>Please use normal English. DON'T USE ALL UPPERCASE FOR YOUR TITLES OR IN THE BODY OF YOUR POST. It comes across as shouting. Also avoid txt msg abbreviations.</li>

      <h3>Bad Things</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The Forums are for discussion, not self-promotional link-posting. Avoid posting promotional or irrelevant links.</li>
        <li>No cross-posting. Posting the same message to more than one Forum or thread is seen as spamming.</li>
        <li>If you've been banned: If you attempt to post in the Forums after being banned for a violation, you will see a link to the thread where the violation occurred, and a notification of when your Forum privileges have been scheduled to be reinstated. Each subsequent violation will incur longer ban durations, and eventually your Forum privileges may be permanently revoked. So please familiarize yourself with our rules before posting again.</li>
      </ul>

        <li>Only use the report button on posts you think break the forum rules. Please do not report posts just because you do not like them.</li>
