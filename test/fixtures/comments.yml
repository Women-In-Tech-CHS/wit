One day, just one day, maybe I'll meet somebody who gets the whole 'don't wander off' thing. Now, don't antagonize her. I love a happy medium! Lots of planets have a North. Ricky, if I was to tell you what I was doing to the controls of my frankly magnificent timeship, would you even begin to understand? You look beautiful! ...considering. That you're human. Nice to meet you, Rose."
